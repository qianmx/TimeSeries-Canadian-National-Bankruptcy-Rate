# Time Series: Canadian Bankruptcy Rates Forecasting
Author: Mengxin Qian, Vyakhya Sachdeva, Anshika Srivastava

##Introduction

This report aims to document our efforts towards creating Canadian bankruptcy rate forecast models using time series analysis. The models are composed and validated for the period from  January 1987 to December 2010. Composed models are then used to forecast bankruptcy rate in the years of 2011-2012. We also incorporated other macroeconomic trends, which can be good predictors of bankruptcy rate in our model including Unemployment Rate, Population, Housing Price Index.

###2. Data

####2.1 Data Summaries & Definitions

The dataset has information at a monthly granularity level starting January 1987 until December 2010, which is a sufficiently large range in time for carrying out a time series analysis. Henceforth in this report we will call this the training dataset, as our model will be “trained” using these observations.
