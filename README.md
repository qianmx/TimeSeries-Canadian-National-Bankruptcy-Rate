# Time Series: Canadian Bankruptcy Rates Forecasting

##Introduction

This project presents the analysis and construction of SARIMA,HotlWinter,ARIMAX,VAR time series models to accurately forecast monthly national bankruptcy rates in Canada.

The models are composed and validated for the period from  January 1987 to December 2010. Composed models are then used to forecast bankruptcy rate in the years of 2011-2012. We also incorporated other macroeconomic trends, which can be good predictors of bankruptcy rate in our model including Unemployment Rate, Population, Housing Price Index.
